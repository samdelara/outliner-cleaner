# Outliner Cleaner 1.0 for Blender

## Overview
Welcome! This add-on is meant to make it easier to organize and rename the outliner of most versions of Blender above 2.80. 
This tool was created to speed up the process with organizing a user's outliner in Blender. Natively, it is very hard to edit multiple names of objects at once and it is hard to even name all of them an iteration of the same name. I knew many other developers felt this frustration and is why I created this tool not only for me, but for all to use.
